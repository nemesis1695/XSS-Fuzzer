# XSS-Fuzzer
XSS Fuzzer

This code is a simple tool written in the Go programming language and is used for testing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities in websites. The tool has the capability to generate various random payloads using symmetric and asymmetric encodings, which are then used to craft XSS attacks. Additionally, it can produce payloads specifically designed to bypass firewalls.

To use this tool, the user needs to provide the target URL they want to test for XSS vulnerability as input. The tool then generates different payloads for XSS testing and sends them as input to the specified URL to test for potential vulnerabilities. By running this tool, users can utilize the generated payloads to test for XSS vulnerabilities on websites and identify and address any security issues present.
